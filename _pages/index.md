Welcome to my blog! I'm a current University of New South Wales student studying Mathematics and Marketing, who as a weird obsession with Machine Learning. 

This blog is intended to be used as a diary I look back at and see my journey firsthand. Of course, another important part of it is to share knowledge across the world. It has been my lifelong aspiration to help people learn, from tutoring students and helping peers. I hate when someone says, "Oh, this is so hard; I'm never going to get it!" Along the journey, I wish to help people understand concepts easier and more intuitively. Although my main focus will be on machine learning, I will blog about anything I find interesting!

# How did i get into Machine Learning? 

# Which Machine Learning algorithms am i interested in?

I do love a little linear regression, but I'm super intrigued by deep learning.


# Well, what do I find interesting other than Machine Learning?

I'm a massive fan of sports; I can just about watch any sport and be invested. My favorite sport is National Rugby League (NRL). Never heard of it? Well, just think of it as rugby, but instead of a massive scrum tackles, you can only hold a person down for 5 seconds, and then you have to play the ball. It's super fast and entertaining!

Also, I'm a massive fan of fitness and working out. I try to constantly keep reading and watching YouTube videos and research papers on how to optimize workout regimens and recovery. So you'll see a little bit of that in here too!
