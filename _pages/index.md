Welcome to my blog! Graudate University of New South Wales student studying Mathematics and Marketing, who has a obession with learning!

This blog is intended to be used as a diary I look back at and see my journey firsthand. Of course, another important part of it is to share knowledge across the world. It has been my lifelong aspiration to help people learn, from tutoring students and helping peers. I hate when someone says, "Oh, this is so hard; I'm never going to get it!" Along the journey, I wish to help people understand concepts easier and more intuitively. Although my main focus will be on machine learning, I will blog about anything I find interesting!

# Carrer Goals?

Studying such a broad degree, I was lost in the options of which industry I wanted to move into. Unsure of my decision, I decided to start learning about AI, thinking it would be an important skill regardless of the path I chose. Along my journey of learning AI, particularly through a Deep Learning Specialisation and self-learning journey, I was led to compete in a data science competition held by Allianz and Atlassian. Coincidentally, the task was to classify fraudulent insurance claims — a blog post about this can be found [Allianz Data Science Competiion](/_posts/2024-08-06-Atlassian-Allianz-data-soc.md).

This experience sparked my interest in a potential role in insurance. For the first time, I knew what I wanted to do! I understood that, having no experience in the industry, I needed to get my foot in the door.

Thus, I stepped into my first role as a Claims Consultant at Chubb Insurance. Not only did I gain hands-on experience in learning the fundamentals of the claims management process and lifecycle, but I also received my first introduction to policy wording and interpretation, particularly in accident and health. This only continued to fuel my excitement about the insurance industry — I've learned so much about the different roles, the intricacies of the industry, and the opportunities it offers. Over this period, I’ve been driven to continue my journey and develop my skills within the insurance industry — with a special focus on broking, underwriting, and actuarial capabilities.

To continue my learning in a structured way, I plan to follow the Master of Actuarial Studies program offered by UNSW. My aim is to focus first on foundational skills that can be applied as a broker and underwriter, and eventually move toward developing skills that can be applied as an actuary.
