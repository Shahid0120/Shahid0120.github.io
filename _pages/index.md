Welcome to my blog! I'm a current University of New South Wales student studying Mathematics and Marketing, who as a weird obsession with Machine Learning. 

This blog is intended to be used as a diary I look back at and see my journey firsthand. Of course, another important part of it is to share knowledge across the world. It has been my lifelong aspiration to help people learn, from tutoring students and helping peers. I hate when someone says, "Oh, this is so hard; I'm never going to get it!" Along the journey, I wish to help people understand concepts easier and more intuitively. Although my main focus will be on machine learning, I will blog about anything I find interesting!

# But wait, how did i get into Machine Learning? 

Well, I've always been interested in self-improvement. This interest started at a young age, focusing not only on becoming more effective in my studies but also on optimizing my mental and physical well-being. I regularly listen to inspiring figures like Andrew Huberman, Lex Friedman, and many more. More specifically, my journey into Machine Learning began when I took a course at UNSW called "Digital and Web Analytics." One of the assessment tasks was to perform a sentiment analysis on a crisis a company had gone through.

Initially confused about what "sentiment analysis" entailed, I started exploring scientific papers, attending random lectures, and kept encountering the term "Machine Learning." Somehow, I created a sentiment analysis of public opinion on whether comments on YouTube and Twitter were positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing. I coded, but I faced one big problemâ€”I had no idea how the sentiment analysis packages worked.

Additionally, while navigating this, I was concurrently enrolled in a course on "Linear Models," delving into topics like linear regression, which significantly sparked my interest. Unfortunately, the lectures never explained anything about what Machine Learning is! Why! Fueled by motivation to learn how exactly a machine categorizes words and wha alternative are there to linear regression, I scoured the internet to learn more, eventually leading me to discover the vast world of Machine Learning! And that's the current journey I'm on now, and I can't wait to learn more!

# Which Machine Learning algorithms am i interested in?

I do love a little linear regression, but I'm super intrigued by deep learning.

# Well, what do I find interesting other than Machine Learning?

I'm a massive fan of sports; I can just about watch any sport and be invested. My favorite sport is National Rugby League (NRL). Never heard of it? Well, just think of it as rugby, but instead of a massive scrum tackles, you can only hold a person down for 5 seconds, and then you have to play the ball. It's super fast and entertaining!

Also, I'm a massive fan of fitness and working out. I try to constantly keep reading and watching YouTube videos and research papers on how to optimize workout regimens and recovery. So you'll see a little bit of that in here too!
