# Review of Standford CS290 course 

## Summary 
- Requires at least level 2 unviersity mathematcis. This includes understanding of Multivariate calculus and a bit of Linear ALgebra 
- Lectures provides the backbone understanding but doesnt devle into the mathemnatics. Inorder to maximise learning process ensure completing all Problem sets
- Student after completing course create there own machine learing application. I suggest completing one aswell. 
- Having a strong udnerstanding in Linear Models is benefitial to understanding most concepts due to the fast pace of the course.
