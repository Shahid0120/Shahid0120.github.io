# Ever though why it is based to use our test set multiple times?

When learning machine learning one of the first thigns you lear is to always split your data into 2 part; training and test set. Generally, if it a larger data set then 90/10 split or a smaller dataset a 80/20 split, respectively. Why is that though?
