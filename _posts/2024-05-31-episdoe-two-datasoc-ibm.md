Today was the first lecutre from Dr. Saeed Kasmani, a Senior AI engineer from IBM and the agenda was explroing 
EDA, Data cleaning & profiling, Assessing data quality, Data rejection & imputation, Exploring & visualising 
categorical/continuous data and Feature Engineering

# Data Science flowchart 
## 1. Making data Usable 
the first steps of making raw data usuable is under 4 terms data wranlgeing, profialig, cleanring and munging. 
In data wrangle the goals is to is fix critical issuess, including sourcing, laoding and preclearning the data. 
Data profiling and cleaning main goals is to understand the essential characterisic of the data, thoruhg aplpying transformation of features and implemeting strategies for missing data and invlid data. 
Lastly data muging is reshapding data to perform anaysis (Exploratory data analysis) 

## 2. Explroatory data analysis
An approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, through data visualisation or statisitcal graphs, with the main goal of is it a useful proxy for our learning model, client objective?

## 3. Developing anlaystics and models to adresss our original problem 
This is the stage we use different stratistical learning algorithms create deicsion boundaries, either thoruhg parametric or non-parametric methods.

# Exploring Data Wrangling 
The following is a referenced using 'Principles of Data Wrangling: Practical Techniques for Data Preparation' by Tye Rattenbury, Connor Carreras, Sean Kandel, Joseph M. Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer

# Role of data preposing 
According to the authors, data scientist spend 50 - 80 % of there times on data preproccessing and EDA rather then statistical learning algorithms.

# Obtaining the MAgic threshold 
Given we want to a social media company wants to grow as a core objective, the analytics team main objective is to create a magic threshold which (1) has a concise KPI target thats predicts the objective (2) is actionable. Example 'key predictor of new engagement is new users tshould conenct 10 friedns within 14 days'.

# Data stages
There are three mains stages of data preproccessing including (1) Raw stage (2)Refined Stage and (3) Production stage each stage has its own
