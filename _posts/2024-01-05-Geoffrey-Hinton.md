I just wanted to take some time and appreciate the man who is David Goggins. He is someone I have admired for years. The man is the definition of hard work always beating talent. No matter where you are at in life, you don't have to have started off at 15 years old working towards your dream.

Weirdly enough, I've seen a lot of people around me recently settling down into full-time roles and, I guess, kind of just accepting where they are at in life. I currently work at officeowkrs, where I get to interact with slightly older co-workers, and I always hear "I'm too old to change my job," "I'm too old to learn this now." I am just astonished at the little self-belief and motivation some people have. Now, don't get me wrong; there is nothing bad about working at officeowkrs, but the importance of having a job that allows you to explore your creativity and limits is something that I hold very highly.

Even my mum, when she says recently, "Oh, I won't be able to learn sewing these clothes; I'll just give it to the lady even though I'm not happy with her services." Like DAM mum, come on, age does not equal can't learn new things.

I remember watching a Huberman podcast about how to learn faster, and he states one of the most important things is "failure" leads to skill acquisition; right now, that's definitely true with the relationship I have with LeetCode. Humph. But that's the process; it's failure leading to success.

Now going back to David Goggins, his transformation started a lot older in his life, and I know many people can't believe how someone can turn their life around once it's settled down. Funny enough, I remember Joe Rogan talking about how Hitler was just a normal soldier until one day he became this leader out of nowhereâ€”I put it down to cocaine. Hahaha. People just don't believe change can come.

Importantly, many people reserve his mindset for physical activity, one of which I always questioned, 'I'm a student; he doesn't spend hours studying though.' I feel like physically exerting yourself is a lot easier to me than mentally exercising yourself. But are these two fruits from the same tree? Well, I guess so. My mind is completely changed now; David Goggins is becoming a paramedic, even though he has diagnosed severe ADHD, stating his state ranking marks. In a recent podcast with Andrew Huberman (link here), David Goggins explores his latest endeavor, emphasizing his daily challenge of fighting the urges of drugs. For years, Goggins has been an advocate of the importance of doing tasks you don't like in building an indomitable mind and body. Interestingly, he talks about how much he hates running, yet every day he wakes up and runs a marathon. Finally, it's been scientifically proven: the importance of doing tasks you don't like to build a part of your brain

My final thoughts: Am I  doing everything I can?
