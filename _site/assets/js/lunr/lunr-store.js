        "excerpt":"Welcome to My Blog!   Welcome! This is my very first post on my new blog, and I’m thrilled to share my journey of exploration and information-sharing with fellow students like myself!   Most important question first, so how did I get into Machine Learning?   Well, I’ve always been interested in self-improvement. This interest started at a young age, focusing not only on becoming more effective in my studies but also on optimizing my mental and physical well-being. I regularly listen to inspiring figures like Andrew Huberman, Lex Friedman, and many more. More specifically, my journey into Machine Learning began when I took a course at UNSW called “Digital and Web Analytics.” One of the assessment tasks was to perform a sentiment analysis on a crisis a company had gone through.   Initially confused about what “sentiment analysis” entailed, I started exploring scientific papers, attending random lectures, and kept encountering the term “Machine Learning.” Somehow, I created a sentiment analysis of public opinion on whether comments on YouTube and Twitter were positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing. I coded, but I faced one big problem—I had no idea how the sentiment analysis packages worked.   Additionally, while navigating this, I was concurrently enrolled in a course on “Linear Models,” delving into topics like linear regression, which significantly sparked my interest. Unfortunately, the lectures never explained anything about what Machine Learning is! Why! Fueled by motivation to learn how exactly a machine categorizes words and wha alternative are there to linear regression, I scoured the internet to learn more, eventually leading me to discover the vast world of Machine Learning! And that’s the current journey I’m on now, and I can’t wait to learn more!  ","categories": ["Miscellaneous"],

        "title": "CS229 Review",
        "excerpt":"Review of Standford CS229 course   Summary     Requires at least level 2 university mathematics. This includes an understanding of Multivariate Calculus and a bit of Linear Algebra.   Lectures provide the backbone understanding but don’t delve into the mathematics. In order to maximize the learning process, ensure completing all problem sets.   Standford students, after completing the course, create their own machine learning application. I suggest completing one as well.   Having a strong understanding of Linear Models is beneficial to understanding most concepts due to the fast pace of the course.   Comprehensive Review   Introduction   After wanting to learn machine learning, I scoured the internet to find the best resources, knowing there was an unimaginable amount of books, videos, tutorials, and articles, it just left me confused and flustered!   To narrow my focus, I wanted to learn from the best, so who really is the best academic in the machine learning space? Well, everyone unanimously agrees that Andrew Ng is probably the best ML teacher, and he offers amazing courses such as on Coursera. But after hearing about the world-famous CS229 as the origin of many students’ introduction to ML, I decided to take the 2018 CS229 course by Stanford.   Who is this course for?   Don’t take this course if you don’t have at least a level 2 university-level mathematics course previously. The main value in this course is it takes a dive into the mathematics behind popular machine learning algorithms. Since the focus is on mathematics, I’ve read many comments under the lecture videos stating, “Is it okay if I don’t understand the mathematics?” Well, not really, since I feel there are better resources less focused on the mathematics and provide an intuitive understanding, such as “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” and “The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov,” which just give an overview of the algorithms focusing on implementation over mathematics.   Is it okay to watch the 2018 version with Andrew Mg over the new iterations of the course?   Many popular machine learning algorithms have been around for decades. Since this course aims to focus on the most popular algorithms in machine learning, these algorithms have been established decades ago. Let me give you an example:      Linear Regression: Sir Francis Galton in 1895   Support Vector Machine: AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues in 1993   Principal Component Analysis: Karl Pearson in 1901   As you can see these algorithsm have been discovered decades ago. I would recommend doing the 2018 course so you can gain a true understanding of why Andrew Ng is considered one of the best ML teachers.   How to acess the other class material, like problem sets and lectures notes?   Supplement with the lectures are problems seta dn lectures notes. I’v found watching #link(statques) as well as #(github)   What to do next?   After completing the course, you should feel that you have a strong basic understanding of popular machine learning algorithms. It is important that you don’t just watch the lectures but also ensure you understand everything you’ve watched. Ensure you use the Feynman technique to try to explain concepts in your own words and don’t get trapped into the bubble of just watching lectures and thinking you know the concepts because when the interview comes around, how can you explain these concepts to the interviewer?   Personally, I’ll be now taking the “Machine Learning Specialization” as well as creating my own scikit-learn emulation module to improve my ML and programming skills. I recommend you continue a similar path, now trying to do Kaggle problems or start.   Concluding   Watching CS290 has been a beatiful journey and i really appriate standford making this course acceisble to everyone if you want notes here!   ","categories": ["Review"],

        "excerpt":"I just wanted to take some time and appreciate the man who is David Goggins. He is someone I have admired for years. The man is the definition of hard work always beating talent. No matter where you are at in life, you don’t have to have started off at 15 years old working towards your dream.   Weirdly enough, I’ve seen a lot of people around me recently settling down into full-time roles and, I guess, kind of just accepting where they are at in life. I currently work at officeowkrs, where I get to interact with slightly older co-workers, and I always hear “I’m too old to change my job,” “I’m too old to learn this now.” I am just astonished at the little self-belief and motivation some people have. Now, don’t get me wrong; there is nothing bad about working at officeowkrs, but the importance of having a job that allows you to explore your creativity and limits is something that I hold very highly.   Even my mum, when she says recently, “Oh, I won’t be able to learn sewing these clothes; I’ll just give it to the lady even though I’m not happy with her services.” Like DAM mum, come on, age does not equal can’t learn new things.   I remember watching a Huberman podcast about how to learn faster, and he states one of the most important things is “failure” leads to skill acquisition; right now, that’s definitely true with the relationship I have with LeetCode. Humph. But that’s the process; it’s failure leading to success.   Now going back to David Goggins, his transformation started a lot older in his life, and I know many people can’t believe how someone can turn their life around once it’s settled down. Funny enough, I remember Joe Rogan talking about how Hitler was just a normal soldier until one day he became this leader out of nowhere—I put it down to cocaine. Hahaha. People just don’t believe change can come.   Importantly, many people reserve his mindset for physical activity, one of which I always questioned, ‘I’m a student; he doesn’t spend hours studying though.’ I feel like physically exerting yourself is a lot easier to me than mentally exercising yourself. But are these two fruits from the same tree? Well, I guess so. My mind is completely changed now; David Goggins is becoming a paramedic, even though he has diagnosed severe ADHD, stating his state ranking marks. In a recent podcast with Andrew Huberman link here!, David Goggins explores his latest endeavor, emphasizing his daily challenge of fighting the urges of drugs. For years, Goggins has been an advocate of the importance of doing tasks you don’t like in building an indomitable mind and body. Interestingly, he talks about how much he hates running, yet every day he wakes up and runs a marathon. Finally, it’s been scientifically proven: the importance of doing tasks you don’t like to build a part of your brain   My final thoughts: Am I  doing everything I can?

        "excerpt":"A lense from a statistical point of view. Can we create a ML model to predicit the outcomes?   Introduction   After watching sports for many years, I noticed non-contact injuries, especially in the NBA. I went on to examine it. Randomly, I clicked on a video where a popular YouTuber states, ‘Look at KD; he had an ACL injury, and before that, he had a calf strain.’ Is this really true? The YouTube channel mentioned is MPJPerformance, and the video link is here!

Identify all injured playes easily   Idenify length of injury easily   Identify if this play has prior/future injury   Proximity of next injury/prior injury   Based on these retrival goals we can take a view from a statisatical POV if “long term injuries are srouced from short term injuries”. Where we can explore…   As pointed out by Chip Huyen in Chapter two of “Designing Machine Learning Systems” states the importance of Data Models “How you choose to represent data not only affects the way your systems are built, but also the problems your systems can solve”. Using this chapter as a out Chip outlines “NoSQL” to follow a strict schema, therefore for time saving we will use a “Relational Database”.

        "excerpt":"Reading to Keras/Tensorflow documentation, it’s a little hard to understand what exactly is the difference between sequential and functional API and all other resources are too long to read, so lets simplify it!   Lets talk visually:      The whole point of Tensorflow with Keras is to simply the process of creating neural networks so now we dont spend time on manully coding a neural network, but rather focus on improving the performance of our model. Now how exactly does Functional api improve flexibility but at the cost of complexity?   Sequential API  Sequential API’s tipically look like this:      Notice, although we specify the pooling dimensions and strides and other arguements within the tf.keras.layers call , we can’t input specific paramters like Z1,A1 or Z2. Importantly it all happens sequentially so the model will start from the top end go by each call one by one until the end.   Function API : spot the difference  Alternatively, comparing this to functional API it allows use to play around with the parameters:      Notice how we adding paramters to our calls to tf.keras.layers()(Paramter) providing us flexibility to choose which parameters we want to trasnform. Note this is just one way of taking advantage of function API. Other possible options are :     Multiple inputs - Now we can have multiple paramters since our functional isnt called linearly   Sharing inputs - say we want Z1 to have multiple acitivations say Leaky-RelU and ReLU   But as you can see the possibility or errors increases since you can play around with which inputs you want where. So be careful!   Conclusion   Hopefully now you understand the difference between Sequential and Functional API!  ","categories": ["Machine Learning"],

        "title": "Roadmap to Learn Transformers in less then 3 minutes",
        "excerpt":"When I started my journey into machine learning, I remember watching an interview with Andrej Karpathy, a Sr. Director of AI at Tesla, on the Lex Fridman podcast, where he talked about something called a “transformer,” and he described it so profoundly as a new way of computing. In combination, I had learned that ChatGPT, BERT were all powered by transformers and that in order to become a machine learning engineer, you NEEDED to know transformers.   But upon looking online for a simple roadmap of the topic I needed to cover, I found that most blog posts focus on the individual components you need to know inside a transformer architecture rather than how to get to the point to potentially understand a transformer architecture.   Definition of Transformer: Machine learning architectures that allow asking multiple questions about an input and receiving answers out of questions from surrounding inputs, which helps us compute an output!   So lets beging   1 . Some basic understanding on Machine Learning   Definition of Machine Learning: process of exploring data using mathematics to create scalable and reusable algorithms in order to make decisions/improve society. Pretty much give an algorithm some data with output or no outputs and hope it can solve new data using this given data.   Machine Learning is broken down into two parts: Supervised and Unsupervised learning (kinda there are a few subsets of machine learning, but we only need to focus on these)   Supervised: given we feed the algorithm with pairs of inputs and corresponding outputs. The goal of supervised learning is to feed new inputs and try to figure out an output.   Unsupervised learning: where you feed the algorithm inputs and outputs, but your goal isn’t to predict new outputs but rather identifying patterns, visualizations, etc.   I recommend just going through “The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book” by Andriy Burkov, getting a basic grip of the concepts.   So a subset of machine learning techniques is deep learning. A part of deep learning is the transformer architecture.      Deep learing   Now the main concept you should learn is:      Feedfoward Neural Networks -&gt; Focus!   CNN - the basics   RNN - learn GRU’s and LSTM’s   Attention Architecture   Transformers Architecture   You should complete these processes in order and ensure you have a strong understanding of feedforward neural networks.

        "title": "Olympiad Level Counting Made Easy with Jensen's inequality",
        "excerpt":"Have you every wondered how high school students with no formal higher level of mathematical knowledge are able to solve complex questions like this? Prove that   \\[\\frac{1}{x-1}+ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x+1} \\geq \\frac{3}{x},\\quad x &gt; 1.\\]  Or   \\[(1 + \\frac{1}{x})(1 + \\frac{1}{y})(1 + \\frac{1}{z}) \\geq 64.\\]  Many of you have no idea how some 14 year old kid is able to solve these questions, yet at my final year of university, I am still not able to intuitively solve these. I believe that this is true for most university students.   Now, of course, the most rational method would be trying to move all the variables to one side, then try estimating the values for which the right-hand side equals the left-hand side. Then, the exam hits you with give me exact values for \\(x,y,z\\) and now you are stumped with this 1 hour exam and  you’ll just about spend most of your time guessing possible values. Here comes the bang, Olympiad contestants in my eyes now are of course genius, but they know a set of specialised tools in their tool bag of which they select the appropriate tool for the job. Now, selecting a the right tool can be difficult (Mathematics tool bags a very,very deep).   One of the most powerful tools in the mathematics tool bag : Jensen’s Inequality.  For any convex function \\(h\\), we have,   \\[\\mathbb{E}h(Y) \\geq h(\\mathbb{E}Y)\\]  How did we get to conclusion of the great ‘power’ of Jensen’s Inequality? According to my professor, Dr.Zdravko Botev, power comes from two key characteristics (1) simplicity (2) usefulness. Not only is Jensen Inequality applicable in a range of context, including counting as above, but also real analysis, probability, economics, statistics, and machine learning, but it’s proof that it is so simple.   \\(\\textit{Proof.}\\) From the definition of convexity, we have for x and all Y:   \\[h(Y) \\geq h(x) + v^T(Y-x)\\]  By the monotonicty and linearity of expectation, we have   \\[\\mathbb{E}h(Y) \\geq h(x) + v^T\\mathbb{E}(Y-x)\\]  Now, since this is true for each \\(x\\) we can chose \\(x = \\mathbb{E}(Y)\\). So,   \\[\\mathbb{E}h(Y) \\geq h(\\mathbb{E}Y) + v^T\\mathbb{E}(Y-\\mathbb{E}Y) \\Rightarrow  \\mathbb{E}h(Y) \\geq h(\\mathbb{E}Y).\\]  Which is Jensen’s Inequality.   Now, how do we apply this powerful tool to our counting problem?  The idea is that we want to find a convex function which applies to the problem and hence we can use Jensen’s Inequality. So, for:   \\[\\frac{1}{x-1}+ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x+1} \\geq \\frac{3}{x},\\quad x &gt; 1.\\]  We can try \\(h(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) or \\(h(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 1}\\) or \\(h(x) = \\frac{1}{x - 1}\\) and we can confirm that these a convex function by showing  \\(h\"(x) &gt; 0, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Now, lets try  \\(h(x) = \\frac{1}{x}, x &gt; 1\\). Now, for a random variables \\(Y\\) we apply Jensen’s Inequality,   \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\frac{1}{Y}] \\geq \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}Y}\\]  Next we consider a distribution for \\(Y\\). Since, we have 3 fractions a logical choice would be for \\(Y\\) distribution,   \\[\\mathbb{P}(Y = x) = \\mathbb{P}(Y = x + 1) = \\mathbb{P}(Y = x - 1) = \\frac{1}{3}.\\]  For this \\(Y\\), we have a three point distribution, we can compute the expectations and hence Jensen’s inequality,   \\[\\begin{align*}     \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{1}{Y}] = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x - 1} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x + 1}, \\\\     \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}Y} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x - 1} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{x + 1}} = \\frac{1}{x}. \\end{align*}\\]  So,   \\[\\begin{align*}     \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{1}{Y}] &amp;\\geq \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}Y} \\Rightarrow \\\\     \\frac{1}{3}[\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x+1}] &amp;\\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\Rightarrow \\\\     \\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x+1} &amp;\\geq \\frac{3}{x}. \\end{align*}\\]  Wala! Wasn’t that hard, right? Maybe you can try this one,   \\[(1 + \\frac{1}{x})(1 + \\frac{1}{y})(1 + \\frac{1}{z}) \\geq 64.\\]  hint: \\(h(x) = \\text{ln}(1 + \\frac{1}{x})\\)  ","categories": ["Statistics"],

        "title": "Line Search Methods for Numerical Optimisation",
        "excerpt":"Linear Search Methods are a integral part of numerical optimisation, which is a set of algorithms to solve mathematics programming problems. Importantly, numerical optimisation are solved in two key methods;     Linear search strategy   Trust region   This blog post will focus on the linear search strategy for optimisation techniques. This blog post requires a basic understanding on optimisation - objective functions, variables and constrained, so lets get into it.   What is line search and trust region, how do they differ?   Our main goal with optimsiation is to find a global minimimum points which in real life minimum point which reduced the time, cost etc. Now given we can algebraically find this optimal solution through other optimisation techniques. Let’s see an example,   \\[\\begin{align*} \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\quad &amp; x^2 - sin(x)\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]  Now, if we were to use algebratic methods using First order sufficient condition we find the unconstrained stationary point by $\\triangledown f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$. But,   \\[\\triangledown f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0} \\Leftrightarrow 2x - cos(x) = 0\\]  So the only way to finding a $ x $ algebratically is through guessing possible $ x $ values, even though the solution exists,      So this is where numerical optimsiation comes in. In essense rather then using algebraic methods to solve the optimisation problem we now is iterative process through a starting point $ x^{(0)} $ and then generatign a sequecnes of sets $ x^{(k)} $ which termiantes when a global minimum is reached, $ x^* $. Finding a new iteration step $ x^{(k)} $ is through finding where the rule of function value decreases known as decent methods,   \\[\\begin{align*} f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) \\end{align*}\\]  We denote $ s^{(k)} $ as a search direction, which is is just given a point, $ x^{(k)} $ in which direction we move in?  so intutively with no restricstion $ s^{(k)} $ can be in all directions from at point $ x^{(k)} $. Now, since restricitions imposed on $ x^{(k)} $ is the decent method how do apply this?   Definition : At a point $ x^{(k)} $ , a direction $ s^{(k)} $ is a descent direction if   \\[\\begin{align*} \\triangledown f(x^{(k)})^T s^{k} &lt; 0  \\end{align*}\\]  Why?   Now $\\triangledown f(x) $ points in direction of , so by taking $ - \\triangledown f(x) $ we point any $ x $ to direction of steepest descent. So, $ \\triangledown f(x^{(k)})^T s^{k} &lt; 0 $.   So, since we know that $ s_{(k)} $ can be in any direction then to restirict we want all search direction which ensures we are in descent getting closer to minimiser ,      Intitively, we want to next iteration to be $ x^{(k + 1)} $ to be as a know in ferences to out previous iteration,  $ x^{(k)} $, and  $ s^{(k)} $, but since our search direction is also a vector direction we we dont impose a ‘length’ the search direction can be then we can overeach out minimiser $ x^* $      So we impose a step length $ \\alpha_{k} $, in most algorithms, we will chose a step-size and after eahc iterations we optimise the step-size inrdoer to find the optimal ‘jump’ we want to impose.   Therfore by definition $ s^{(k)}$ is in decent direction of  $ x^{(k)} $, if $ f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)})$ where we define $ x^{(k + 1)} =  x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)} $. Our goals is to prove that this is try using our definition of decent direction.   Let $ l(\\alpha) = f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) $ then $ \\frac{d}{dx}(l(\\alpha)) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) $ when $ x^{(k)} = 0$ then, intuitively, if we can show that $ l’(\\alpha) &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow l(\\alpha) &lt; l(0) \\Rightarrow f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) $. Visually, in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ for this to hold true then ,      So, since $ x^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $ we have to use the chain rule to find  $ \\frac{d}{dx}f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) $. Let $x_{i}(\\alpha) = x_{i}^{(k)} + \\alpha s_{n}^{(k)}$ for all $ i \\in \\mathbb{Z^+} $ and for a fixed $ x^{(k)}, s^{(k)} $ we have,      Then applying $ \\alpha = 0 \\Rightarrow l’(0) = f(x^{(k)})^Ts^{(k)} $. Now given $ s^{(k)} $ is in decent direction then  $ l’(0) = f(x^{(k)})^Ts^{(k)} &lt; 0 $ so hence, $ f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)}) $   How do we ensure that we pick a point $ x^{(k+1)} $ such that $ f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) $ is closest to $ x^* $?  Finally, the process is known line search strategy which by definition is   \\[\\begin{align*} \\min_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\quad &amp; f(x^{(k)} + \\alpha s^{(k)}) \\end{align*}\\]  Importantly, this is known as exact line search since, finds the optimal step size that minimizes the objective function along the search direction. But there exsit different types of line search including Backtracking Line Search, Golden Section Search, interpolation-Based Line Search. All these line search play around with step size, $ \\alpha $ to find the most optimal method to minimer objective function.   ","categories": ["Statistics"],

        "title": "Statistical Learning Theory Episode One 'Building the foundation' ",
        "excerpt":"Overview  I’v been currently learning about staticial learning theory to gain a mathematical udnertsanding of machine learning. So today the first part of a few psot focusing in undertsanding statistical learning theory. This first post is based on ‘Complete Statistical Theory of Learning (Vladimir Vapnik) | MIT Deep Learning Series’. Lets get into it!   Why do we care about statistical learning theory?   Statistical learnign theory predates today machie learing algorithsm. Originating from Russia in the 1960’s, the key goals was to formualting ‘learning’ through data. Machine learing algorithm take example training data then it infers ‘general ruels’ which can both answer a its label and over time after many samples can generalised to unseen examples known as inductive reasoning/inferences.   This domain of study lead to the now famous algorithsm known as Support Vector Machines which is now a staple of patter recognition.To enable this learning process statistician devleoped a framework to formuale this process; regression, classification, clustering.   Framework of staitsitcal learning theory   General SLT attems to answer 4 main questions;      Which learning tasks can be performed by computers in general (positive and negative results)?   What kind of assumptions do we have to make such that machine learning can be successful a.k.a inductive bias? (Turns out this is inevitable for a sucessfull learning algorithsm “No Free-Lunch Theorem”!)   What are the key properties a learning algorithm needs to satisfy in order to be successful?   Which performance guarantees can we give on the results of certain learning algorithms? - this ones important we want to ensure our mechanism learns the right outcome   Types of learning   We will be focusing on explanation through the leaner-teacher model, in which the learning is the algorithm, the environment is the training data and the teacher guides the experience     Supervised vs unsupervised learning : the learner interects with the environment in suprervised learning the leaners “uses experiences from environment to gain expertise” in which a teacher provides the experiecnes (training data) and then “apply” its experiecnes to new data given by the teacher (test data). However, in unserpvised learning the teacher provides ‘experiences’ to the learner (training data), and the leaner aims to ‘summerise’ the experiences   Active vs Passive : If the learner interects with the enviuronement provided by the teacher (training data) and gives the teacher quiries about the experiecnes then is is an acitvie leaner, else if it doesnt inquire about the experiences and merlery just take the experiecnes in then its is passive   The goals is the teacher naturlally is to provide the best informatio for the leaner to understand the taks as quickly as possible, but course how the teacher learner the task itself is unknown so we assume it is random process. An alternative is adversiary teacher, who pruposefuly provides bad information to see if the leaner undertsanding the experinces, usualyl used in worst-case scienario’s!

        "excerpt":"Recently I’ve been reading a textbook called ‘Data Science and Machine Learning Mathematical and Statistical Methods’ by a previous professor Zdravko I. Botev and i came across an interesting nation ‘approximation-estimation tradeoff’. Uptil now I, like most people was only aware of bias-variacne tradeoff being the most common problem with optimsing mahcine learning algorithms. So the aim of this post of to classify the difference between the two using the aid of a provious textbook and a the article ‘Bias/Variancer is not the same as Approimation/Estimation’ by Gavin brown and Riccardo Ali.   Adressing Perspective’s   Many people are aware that machine learning and data sciecne originated from the field of Statistics and Mathematics, yet many course taught focus on using training data to optimsatie machine learning algorithsm.   So the importanat distinction is ‘approximation-estimation tradeoff was published first and orignates from Statistical learning theory, which focuses on a excess risk in mathematical defintiion (Bayes model), yet bias-variacne trade off focuses on a defintion akin to protical, focusing on the problem risk when using training data for trainfed models, more akin to the problems faced practically in the industry today’   ","categories": ["Statistics"],

        "title": "How I went from 40 WPM to 100 WPM in 3 months without trying!",
        "excerpt":"Flashbacks to high school when all my friends used to engage in typing test battles; touch typing, speed, the whole shebang. Then there was me, trying to look at the keyboard, using two fingers from each hand, and managing a grand total of 40 WPM. HUMPH.   Recently, I’ve begun to understand the importance of being able to type fast and its perks. Not only does it help with completing computer tasks faster, but as technology natives, it’s almost a necessity. More importantly, I believe in having mastery over all parts of my body! I feel there’s some hidden neurological benefits in being able to control your fingers eloquently; it helps in learning other skills faster. From my observations, people who type fast usually pick up instruments a lot quicker compared to myself; trying to learn guitar was extremely difficult!   Here’s a quick rundown of how I improved my typing speed without really following any formal tutorials:   Tip 1: Passive learning using MonkeyType  Practice until mastery. I pretty much just spammed 25-second MonkeyType tests; it’s so easy and doesn’t take much time. Every time you’re about to start a new task, just hop on and smash out a test. Not only does Huberman always say we learn best if we stop thinking for like 10-15 seconds, but it’s also kinda fun trying to beat a previous score like it’s a video game. (I’ve done 400 test already! )   Tip 2: Start from basics, using at least four fingers!   Yeah, this is a tough one, but if you’re currently only using two fingers, you have to move to using four fingers; your learning curve will be exponential. In the beginning, it will be difficult, but as you get used to it, the rate of learning will be insane!   Tip 3: Don’t look at the keyboard   As computer natives, even though we think we don’t know where the keys are, we subconsciously already know where all the letters are on the keyboard; we just need to practice a little!   It’s as simple as that!  ","categories": ["Random"],
